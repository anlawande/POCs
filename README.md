Collection of all my POC codes

**Get Series POC** --- High throughput asynchronous framework code (client-jquery, server-node)

**MyTrie POC** --- custom trie implementation -- supports multiple leaves with same key and anything as leaves

**OptimizrJs POC** --- Grunt style task runner specially for scanning a project for web development best practices tokens (See list of tasks for more details). Also creates an elaborate report of the results.
